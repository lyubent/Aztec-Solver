# Aztec Solver

#### A constraint programming script using the ESSENSE' modeling language.

To run the tool you need to download minion and savile row.

Next simply run savile row and point it to the aztec puzzle script: 

```bash
C:\> java -ea -jar savilerow.jar -in-eprime aztec.eprime -in-param aztec.param -m bin\minion.exe
```

Or if you are using UNIX based OSs.
```bash
loc$> java -ea -jar savilerow.jar -in-eprime aztec.eprime -in-param aztec.param -m bin/minion
```
